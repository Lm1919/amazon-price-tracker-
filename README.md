# amazon-price-tracker-
this project is called amazon price tracker. It uses a python bot to check price of amazon item and compares it with our 
threshold price that we're going to set in the code and we're looking for a decrease in price based on our threshold. if there is indeed 
a decrease, the bot is going to send an alert to an email that we're going to add stating that the item is now available to be purchased.
